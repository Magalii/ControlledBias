# ControlledBias

This branch contains the code used for the experiments presented in the article "*Influence of Label and Selection Bias on Fairness Interventions*" by Magali Legast, Toon Calder and FranÃ§ois Fouss that was accepted at [EWAF2025](https://2025.ewaf.org/home).

## Run experiment code

To reproduce the experiments, run the file 'experiment_ewaf2025.py' with Python.

The OULAD datasets needs to be downloaded beforehand and the different CVS files placed in the directory 'dataset/OULAD'.

Running this code requires several Python module, including :
- aif360
- sklearn
- ucimlrepo (to download the dataset Student)
- pandas
- numpy


### Troubleshooting

- Windows environement :\
    This code was written for a Linux environment. All the paths to files needs to be changed for it to be run in a Windows environment.

## Textual results

The results presented in the paper graphs can also be found in textual form in the file 'textual_results.md'.
